A simulation of the card game WAR!

If you don’t know what the card game WAR is, read this article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game) 

After playing the simple card game with my 7 year old daughter, I had several questions.  Questions like, how long does a typical game last?  How often do you get a WAR (tie)?  How often do you get a double WAR?  Can you ever have an unending game?  I decided to write a program to find answers to these questions.

Also, I’ve never used GitHub before, but I’ve heard this is the place to host your code, so I thought I might as well try it out.

Answers
-------

I've found the answers to my questions.  
How long does a game last? about 270 moves.  
How often do you get a WAR? about 6 every 100 moves.  
How often do you get a double war?  about 3 every 1000 moves.  
Can you have an un-ending game?  YES - if the winner puts his cards back in order, you can play forever.  
How often are there unending games?  about a tenth of all games are unending (if you play perfectly).

Building
--------

Open the [kbWar.sln](kbWar/kbWar.sln) file in Visual Studio 2010 and build the project.  
It should also work in later versions of Visual Studio, but I haven't tested it.
