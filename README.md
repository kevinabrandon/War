A simulation of the card game WAR!

If you don’t know what the card game WAR is, read this article:

After playing the simple card game with my 7 year old daughter, I had several questions.  Questions like, how long does a typical game last?  How often do you get a WAR (tie)?  How often do you get a double WAR?  Can you ever have an unending game?  I decided to write a program to find answers to these questions.

Also, I’ve never used GitHub before, but I’ve heard this is the place to host your code, so I thought I might as well try it out.
